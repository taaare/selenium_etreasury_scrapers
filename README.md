### Selenium-powered Web Scrapers

This was a simple project completed for National Datacare Corporation. It utilizes Selenium to automatically iterate through tens of thousands of statements from the front-end of prominent bank eTreasury services. 
As many of these banks do not have APIs for this purpose, a scraper was deemed necessary. 

While Selenium is typically used for testing, these scrapers required complex user inputs, exception cases, js execution, complex event handling, wait functions, and plenty of other use cases that Selenium excels in when compared to alternative web scraping libraries.
